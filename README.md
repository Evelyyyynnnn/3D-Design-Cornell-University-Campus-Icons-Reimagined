# 📐 3D Design: Cornell Campus Icons Reimagined

This project is a 3D restoration and reconstruction of iconic buildings on the Cornell University campus. Using Unity-based modeling, it showcases Cornell's architectural richness through interactive visualizations and mesh representations.

## 🏛️ Featured Campus Buildings

The following landmarks have been faithfully reconstructed or stylized using 3D tools:

- **McGraw Tower** (麦格劳钟楼):  
  One of the most iconic buildings on campus, standing about 53 meters tall. It houses 21 chimes and plays music regularly, making it a key part of Cornell’s cultural identity.

- **Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art** (约翰逊艺术博物馆):  
  Designed by famed architect I.M. Pei, the museum boasts a unique modernist exterior and holds a vast collection spanning multiple historical eras and cultures.

- **Morrill Hall** (莫里尔楼):  
  Built in 1868, it's one of the oldest buildings on campus. Constructed with red brick and stone, it reflects typical 19th-century architectural style.

- **Sage Chapel** (萨奇教堂):  
  A religious sanctuary blending Gothic Revival and Romanesque Revival styles. It features stained glass windows, murals, and intricate interior design.

- **Upson Hall** (乌普森大厅):  
  A key facility of the College of Engineering. Recently renovated, it now includes state-of-the-art labs and classrooms, designed with sustainability in mind.

- **Human Ecology Building** (人类生态学大楼):  
  A modern green building exemplifying the integration of sustainability and educational design. It includes a green roof and energy-efficient systems.

## 📁 Files & Organization

The models are organized into series folders based on building types and views.

Each folder contains high-fidelity `.glb` files and annotated view images (e.g., Front View, Top View, Right Side View, Wireframe View, etc.).

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Unity (URP pipeline)** for scene rendering and layout
- **Photoshop & Blender** for mesh clean-up and texture editing
- **glTF (.glb)** format for universal compatibility

---

## 🎯 Future Goals
- Integrate interactive WebGL demos via [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) or [Spline](https://spline.design/)
- Animate clock tower sequences and chimes
- Add Cornell campus environment with terrain and vegetation

## 🧠 AI & Modern 3D Tools

With the advancement of computing and large language models (LLMs), several AI-assisted platforms have emerged to simplify and elevate 3D modeling workflows. Besides the Unity that I use for this project, I also highly recommend the following options to try with AI for mesh refinement, texture enhancement, and rapid prototyping:

- [Tripo3D.ai](https://www.tripo3d.ai/app/)
- [Artefacts.ai](https://artefacts.ai/)
- [Meshy AI](https://www.meshy.ai/discover)
- [Genie](https://lumalabs.ai/genie?view=create)
- [Spline AI](https://spline.design/)
- [Sudo AI](https://www.sudo.ai/)
- [3d.csm.ai](https://3d.csm.ai/)
- [Imagine 3D](https://lumalabs.ai/dashboard/imagine)

These platforms complement traditional Unity modeling and offer support for:

- Photogrammetry-to-mesh pipelines
- Prompt-based shape generation
- Automatic UV/texturing and remeshing
- LLM-guided material assignment
